Pyser - A python parser for DXF Files.
Author: Aramis S. H. Fernandes

This parser intents to offer an interface for programs that want to take table
information on tables described into DXF files.

This parser does not take graphics or drawings. And it will probably filter
only information contained into tables. This should work as a tool for people
who works with AutoCAD and spreadsheets.
