Pyser - A python parser for DXF Files.
Author: Aramis S. H. Fernandes

This parser intents to offer an interface for programs that want to take table
information on tables described into DXF files.

This parser does not take graphics or drawings. And it will probably filter
only information contained into tables. This should work as a tool for people
who works with AutoCAD and spreadsheets.

You'll be able to improve the code, if you need to use it for other
purposes. At this moment, I'm interested into parse only text fields,
contained into tables drawn on AutoCAD.

You should check http://o.mk/2b4f for DXF specifications, or search for it
over the internet. In my case, the structures I'm using will do the job.
